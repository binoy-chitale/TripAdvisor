Our 86th and 102nd floor Observation Decks offer the two highest vantage points in New York City. Soaring 1,454 feet above Midtown Manhattan from base to antenna, the Empire State Building is the World's Most Famous Office Building. Named America's favorite building in a poll conducted by the American Institute of Architects, the Empire State Building is one of New York City's top tourist destinations. On a clear day, you can see up to five states from our Observation Decks - New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Guests can enjoy our outdoor viewing area on our open-air 86th floor Observatory, or our indoor climate-controlled viewing areas on the 86th and 102nd floors. We recently launched our new Multimedia Experience as well, which guides visitors through the extraordinary exhibits and breathtaking views with additional depth on the building's history in eight languages - including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Mandarin, Portuguese, Japanese and Korean. The Empire State Building aims to provide entertainment for guests of all ages. Bringing children? Have their picture taken with King Kong himself on our 80th floor from Thursdays through Mondays (12 p.m. until 9 p.m.). Celebrating a first date or an anniversary? Enjoy romantic tunes from our saxophone player from 9 p.m. until midnight every Thursday through Saturday night. Tickets can be purchased through our website. Our celebrated tower lights are often illuminated to commemorate holidays, events and special causes. In the Fall of 2012, we upgraded our tower lighting system from floodlights to one-of-a-kind LED tower lights. The state-of-the-art system allows customized lighting capabilities from a palette of over 16 million colors! To watch some of our recent light shows, visit our YouTube page. Reigning as the world's tallest building from 1931 to 1970, the Empire State Building is known for its distinct Art Deco style. Construction of the renowned icon only took one year and 45 days, and logged more than 7 million man hours. This is the fastest construction to date for a project of its scale. Additionally, from classics like An Affair to Remember and Sleepless in Seattle to recent hits such as Oblivion and Elf, our place in pop culture has been solidified since our early days. In fact, over 200 movies and TV shows have featured the Empire State Building in them!",

St. Paul's Chapel is part of Trinity Wall Street, an Episcopal parish that has been a part of New York City since 1697. The parish is deeply rooted in the city\u2019s and the nation\u2019s history. Established during the British occupation of New York and recognized by royal charter, Trinity was the first Anglican Church (which followed the services of the Church of England and included the King or Queen in its prayers) in Manhattan. St. Paul's Chapel was founded in 1766 as a chapel-of-ease at Broadway and Fulton Street. George Washington prayed there after his inauguration as President in 1789. Located just across the street from the World Trade Center, St. Paul\u2019s played an important role in hosting recovery workers after the attacks of September 11, 2001.",

    "content": "Worship Service Times at Trinity Church Sundays at 9am: Holy Eucharist Sundays at 11:15am: Holy Eucharist Weekdays at 12:05: Holy Eucharist Find a full schedule of worship services here. About Trinity Church Trinity Church, located at Broadway and Wall Street, is an active Episcopal church with a deep history. In 1697, a little over 70 years after the Dutch settled New York as a trading post known as New Amsterdam, Trinity Church was granted a charter by King William III of England. Since then, Trinity has been an integral part of New York City. Today, Trinity Church and St. Paul\u2019s Chapel (just a few blocks north) are the cornerstones of Trinity Church Wall Street, a growing and vibrant Episcopal community. Worship services are offered in Trinity Church throughout the week, including morning and evening prayer and a noonday Eucharist every weekday. On Sunday, the Trinity community gathers for Holy Eucharist at 9am and 11:15am, which is webcast live. All are invited to attend. Music by Trinity\u2019s renowned choir is integrated into many of the services and free concerts are held throughout the fall and spring. Find a calendar of worship services, concerts, and other events here. The steeple\u2019s 12 change-ringing bells are the only set in the United States; they rotate a full 360 degrees, producing a shimmering, cascading sound in a complex combination of changing tonal patterns. They can be heard on Sundays and special occasions. The present building is the third on the site, consecrated in 1846 and designed by British-born architect Richard Upjohn in the 19th century Gothic Revival style. The first church was lost in New York\u2019s Great Fire of 1776 and the second was demolished in 1839, at Upjohn\u2019s suggestion, after heavy snowfall revealed structural problems. The current building is a registered National Historic Landmark. Visitors to the church can view the decorative bronze doors at the Broadway entrance; see some of the oldest stained glass in the United States; or stop for a moment to pray in the nave or All Saint\u2019s Chapel, located in the northwest corner of the church. Trinity\u2019s churchyard is also open to visitors who wish to see the gravesite of Alexander Hamilton and other historical memorials and monuments, or enjoy a moment of quiet in the midst of busy Lower Manhattan. Free guided tours are offered Monday-Friday at 2pm and Sundays after the 11:15am service. Trinity\u2019s Tour app also provides a virtual guide through Trinity and St. Paul\u2019s Chapel. Free Visitors Guides in five languages are also available in the Church Gift Shop.

The most notable film that played there in the early years was Walt Disney's Steamboat Willie which opened in 1928, and introduced American audiences to an adorable rodent named Mickey Mouse. The theatre went \"legit\" from 1930 to 1934, when it was re-christened the Broadway. From 1934 to 1940, the house was once again dedicated to motion picture exhibition, and offered the premiere of Disney's Fantasia in 1939. In 1940, however, it returned to legitimate stage production and, except for a brief stint as a Cinerama movie theatre in the 1950s, has remained in the business of showcasing live theatre ever since. B. S. Moss commissioned architect Eugene DeRosa to design the Colony as part of his chain of movie theatres, many of which also housed vaudeville. The large size of the theatre made it ideal for musical comedies.",

It hits the spot for anyone craving an offbeat (and often surprising) bite of the city's culture easily digested in an hour or two. Quirky, smart, immersive and across the street from beautiful Central Park, it offers a rich taste of the city.\nYou know the city - now hear the stories. Witness New York's rise from remote outpost to city at the center of the world in our 18-minute panoramic film experience, New York Story, in surround-sound on a 75-foot screen. Then travel through time in visionary exhibitions and an entire floor of children's galleries that show why this city has always captivated hearts and minds.\n\"We were absolutely blown away by the film which manages to convey more about New York and its history than one could imagine ever being crammed into 18 minutes.\" - CL, New York NY\nHistory will break free from the textbooks and jump into your life!\nHungry for more? The New-York Historical Society is your neighborhood destination for food and drink, whether you're grabbing a breakfast bite and a delicious cup of coffee at Parliament Coffee & Espresso Bar, or you're looking to relax with a delectable lunch and dinner and a glass of wine at Storico. Then explore the NYHistory Store for unique New York City gifts and exhibition-related merchandise.",

    "content": "The Shubert Theatre had its genesis in the New Theatre, an \"art\" playhouse located on Central Park West that was devoted to serious repertory drama. Although the project was a critical and commercial flop, the New Theatre Group, which included Lee Shubert, leased a plot of land between 44th and 45th street to construct a new venue. The plan was abandoned, but Lee Shubert and Winthrop Ames, a former New Theatre partner, acquired a lease for the site, and built two adjoining playhouses there. Lee and J.J. operated the larger of the two auditoriums, which they named the Sam S. Shubert Memorial Theatre to commemorate their brother, who had died in May 1905. Ames managed the smaller Booth Theatre. Lee chose to build an office/apartment above the theatre, which is now the location of the Shubert Organization's executive offices.",

    "content": "The Ethel Barrymore Theatre is the only surviving theatre of the many Lee and J.J. Shubert built for performers who were affiliated with them. Ethel Barrymore was part of the renowned Barrymore acting dynasty, and her tremendous popularity in New York and London society established her as a household name in the US and England. She had achieved stardom under the management of producer Charles Frohman beginning in 1901. In 1928, the Shuberts offered to build her a theatre and commission a play for her to premiere in her namesake house. The Barrymore is the last theatre Lee and J.J. Shubert built. Designed by Herbert Krapp, its exterior was modeled on the design of public baths in Rome, with a two-story terra-cotta grillwork screen. The interior decor combines Elizabethan, Mediterranean, and Adamsesque styles. The most elaborate interior element is the boxes, which feature a sunburst pattern over a columned portico.",
