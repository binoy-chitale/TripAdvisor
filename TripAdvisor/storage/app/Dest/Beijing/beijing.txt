From contemporary film screenings, to wine tastings, charity events and private functions - it has a mercurial nature that adapts to the needs of the creative spirits that it invites. From a lifestyle and design perspective, POP-UP BEIJING curates an evolving and eclectic collection one-off pieces, ranging from custom-made furniture, locally made jewellery and giftware, hand-crafted ceramics, Chinese rustic and heritage antiques; and antiques and vintage pieces imported directly from Belgium, France and Holland. Our art collection includes original hand-painted propaganda works from North Korea, contemporary Chinese art, Thankas from Tibet, vintage maps of Beijing and China, and original artworks and prints from around the world.

Hundreds of ice scupltures from local and foreign artists are on display from mid-January until the end of February every year. These illuminated sculptures reflect an annual theme, and the festival is set against the backdrop of a frozen waterfall. Festival goers can also watch fireworks and folk performances on the central stage, or enjoy slides and ice skating. The area is closed off during most of the season, so the ice festival is the only time to take in winter views of the Longqing Gorge.",
