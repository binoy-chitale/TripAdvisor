Situated at the historic site on Bernauer Strasse, it extends along 1.4 kilometers of the former border strip. The memorial contains the last piece of Berlin Wall with the preserved grounds behind it and is thus able to convey an impression of how the border fortifications developed until the end of the 1980s. The events that took place here together with the preserved historical remnants and traces of border obstacles on display help to make the history of Germany's division comprehensible to visitors. The memorial is part of the Berlin Wall Foundation, which also includes the Marienfelde Refugee Center Museum, the central site dedicated to the history of flight and emigration in divided Germany. MOBILE TOURGUIDE Visitors to the Berlin Wall Memorial who have a smartphone or a tablet computer with internet access at their disposal have the opportunity to select an individual tour of the memorial grounds for themselves on the memorial's mobile website berliner-mauer.mobi.",

The 300-year old Zeughaus is one of the most important buildings of the Baroque period in Berlin and the oldest buildings at the boulevard Unter den Linden. In 2006 the Permanent Exhibition \u201cGerman History in Images and Artefacts\u201d was inaugurated here; it showcases 2000 years of eventful and enthralling German history as seen within its European context. 8000 selected objects from the extensive collections of the German Historical Museum furnish valuable evidence of history and reveal, on a surface area of 8000 square meters, a fascinating and vivid picture of the past. Supplementing the Permanent Exhibition are specialized temporary exhibitions displayed in the fascinating exhibition building designed by I.M. Pei. The spacious new structure with its glass and steel entrance lobby and distinctive winding staircase was opened in 2003. Definitive events and facets of German history are presented in a variety of special exhibitions on the four floors of the new building.",

With its observation towers, attack dogs, trip wires and armed guards primed to shoot anyone trying to escape to the West, it was known as the \u201cdeath strip.\u201d\nThe park dates back to the early 1990s when local residents, noticing the rapid spread of self-seeded vegetation on the sandy strip of land, began planting trees and calling for the creation of a park. As a result, the city\u2019s politicians included Mauerpark in the city\u2019s bid to host the 2000 Olympics. Although Berlin\u2019s bid for the Olympics was not successful, the plea to build Mauerpark was.\nIn Mauerpark you can take a stroll, lie around, read, play on the swings, play boules and basketball, picnic in the birch grove, get involved in community gardening, go to the Rainbow Playground with the kids, watch musicians and performers in the amphitheatre, have a drink and a bite to eat in the outdoor cafes or hunt for bargains at the Sunday flea market.",

There were more than 200 towers of this type deployed along the border line surrounding West Berlin. The gunports were covered by heavy metal shutters that were pulled up for shooting. The solid construction was meant to protect the soldiers from fire originating from the potential enemy in the West. The cabin on top of the tower was manned around the clock: One surveyed the approaches from the GDR (\"friendly\") side, the other kept his attention on the \"enemy\"- side. This is the only preserved example of this type of watchtower. And the oldest relict of the Berlin wall. We have started a private initiative and have taken over this authentic relic from the City of Berlin.

    "content": "The Museum on the Berlin-Gatow airfield is a branch of the Bundeswehr Museum of Military History. Like its parent agency in Dresden, it does not see itself primarily as a museum of technical history, but rather as a modern museum of cultural history.The Museum in Dresden tells a general cultural history of violence, whereas the Berlin Museum focuses on aerial warfare as the most recent development in the military use of force.Visitors will learn how aerial warfare has altered our views on warfare. The following topics are at the center of our presentation:\u2022 Crossing Borders. Airplanes enable us to transport information, diplomats and casualties quickly and across borders. At the same time, the emergence of the aerial bombing warfare resulted in the abolition of the old dichotomy between front and hinterland.\u2022 Invisible Perpetrators, Invisible Victims. Among other things, aerial warfare is characterized by high speeds, tremendous ranges and increasingly huge kill capacities. These characteristics result in a depersonalization in the relationship between perpetrators and victims.\u2022 Cover instead of Flight. People on the ground are practically unable to escape the violence from the air. They are faced with sudden alarms and have to look for cover in cellars and holes in the ground.\u2022 Role Models. The role of a pilot has changed continuously over the years: In the eyes of his contemporaries, he was a daring technical pioneer and knight of the air, a daredevil, an engine operator and a flight engineer. Pilots were sacrificed and became killers. Not all pilots are men. What will be their role in an era of unmanned aviation?\u2022 Military and Society. The doctrines of employment and the manner of taking responsibility for the protection of lives reflect the political system and self-image of the various air forces. For that reason, military aviation cannot be examined separately but must be seen in the context of its social and political environment.The Museum of Military History on the Berlin-Gatow airfield sees itself a place of learning for military Bundeswehr personnel as well as interested visitors. As an interface between the military and society, it hopes to encourage discussions and to contribute towards the integration of the armed forces into public life in Germany.The museum collection contains more than 200 airplanes, numerous air defence systems and sensors, uniforms, equipment, art, documents and pictures (a total collection of 600,000 items).",

Immerse yourself in the monumental Panorama Installation from the vantage point of a 4-meter high visitors' platform - a perfect illusion of the history of this city. The Berlin artist Yadegar Asisi depicts life at and in the shadow of the Wall on a fictional autumn day in the 1980s on a 1:1 scale. He thus spectacularly brings the divided city to life for young and old alike. The Panorama experience is supplemented by a photo exhibition with over 100 photos of contemporary witnesses, which gives the visitor personal insights into the period of the Wall.",

    "content": "The Theater im Keller was founded on January 3rd, 1987, and offers its visitors more than 150 performances every year. Despite the German name (Theater im Keller translates into \"theater in the basement\"), the theater is on the ground floor rather than in a basement. The name originated in the early years, when the productions took place in a basement vault. As demand grew, Michael Brenncke, the theater's director since 1987, decided to move the production into the premises of a former storefront. Since then, the studio theater has established itself as a small playhouse in Berlin's \"Reuterkiez\" district, and its reputation has spread well beyond the city limits. Primarily, travesty shows are produced and performed here, because that is precisely what the Theater im Keller is renowned for. Since 2009, a contemporary, stylish bar and lounge can be found in the foyer.",

    "content": "Directly at Checkpoint Charlie is Berlin's Trabi Museum, dedicated to the history of the famous car with the two-stroke engine. Serial production of the Trabant started in Zwickau in 1958 and it is definitely the most famous car from East Germany. On display are the various stages of development of the East German people's car and its potential uses for camping or as a military vehicle. Also on display are rarities such as the Trabant P70 with its wooden chassis or the racing Trabi. And if you'd like your own chance to drive a Trabi, all you have to do is cross the street to Trabi World, where you can book various tours through East and West Berlin or along the former course of the Wall.",

The programme focusses on social and political issues, and one of the theatre's distinctive features is a wide range of directing styles, which also includes new forms of dance and musical theatre. Alongside directors from Berlin such as Thomas Ostermeier, Michael Thalheimer, Falk Richter and Marius von Mayenburg internationally renowned directors from abroad work here, for example Alvis Hermanis, Katie Mitchell and the choreographer Constanza Macras. The productions concentrate on telling stories - both classical and contemporary - and on the ensemble, which includes film stars like Nina Hoss and Lars Eidinger. The Schaubuhne is one of the best known German theatres in the world and plays over 100 performances across the globe every year.

Situated at the historic site on Bernauer Strasse, it extends along 1.4 kilometers of the former border strip. The memorial contains the last piece of Berlin Wall with the preserved grounds behind it and is thus able to convey an impression of how the border fortifications developed until the end of the 1980s. The events that took place here together with the preserved historical remnants and traces of border obstacles on display help to make the history of Germany's division comprehensible to visitors. The memorial is part of the Berlin Wall Foundation, which also includes the Marienfelde Refugee Center Museum, the central site dedicated to the history of flight and emigration in divided Germany. MOBILE TOURGUIDE Visitors to the Berlin Wall Memorial who have a smartphone or a tablet computer with internet access at their disposal have the opportunity to select an individual tour of the memorial grounds for themselves on the memorial's mobile website berliner-mauer.mobi.",

The 300-year old Zeughaus is one of the most important buildings of the Baroque period in Berlin and the oldest buildings at the boulevard Unter den Linden. In 2006 the Permanent Exhibition \u201cGerman History in Images and Artefacts\u201d was inaugurated here; it showcases 2000 years of eventful and enthralling German history as seen within its European context. 8000 selected objects from the extensive collections of the German Historical Museum furnish valuable evidence of history and reveal, on a surface area of 8000 square meters, a fascinating and vivid picture of the past. Supplementing the Permanent Exhibition are specialized temporary exhibitions displayed in the fascinating exhibition building designed by I.M. Pei. The spacious new structure with its glass and steel entrance lobby and distinctive winding staircase was opened in 2003. Definitive events and facets of German history are presented in a variety of special exhibitions on the four floors of the new building.",

With its observation towers, attack dogs, trip wires and armed guards primed to shoot anyone trying to escape to the West, it was known as the \u201cdeath strip.\u201d\nThe park dates back to the early 1990s when local residents, noticing the rapid spread of self-seeded vegetation on the sandy strip of land, began planting trees and calling for the creation of a park. As a result, the city\u2019s politicians included Mauerpark in the city\u2019s bid to host the 2000 Olympics. Although Berlin\u2019s bid for the Olympics was not successful, the plea to build Mauerpark was.\nIn Mauerpark you can take a stroll, lie around, read, play on the swings, play boules and basketball, picnic in the birch grove, get involved in community gardening, go to the Rainbow Playground with the kids, watch musicians and performers in the amphitheatre, have a drink and a bite to eat in the outdoor cafes or hunt for bargains at the Sunday flea market.",

There were more than 200 towers of this type deployed along the border line surrounding West Berlin. The gunports were covered by heavy metal shutters that were pulled up for shooting. The solid construction was meant to protect the soldiers from fire originating from the potential enemy in the West. The cabin on top of the tower was manned around the clock: One surveyed the approaches from the GDR (\"friendly\") side, the other kept his attention on the \"enemy\"- side. This is the only preserved example of this type of watchtower. And the oldest relict of the Berlin wall. We have started a private initiative and have taken over this authentic relic from the City of Berlin. The purchase of your ticket or a donation will help us to restore this document of a bygone era further and assure its upkeep in the future.",

    "content": "The Museum on the Berlin-Gatow airfield is a branch of the Bundeswehr Museum of Military History. Like its parent agency in Dresden, it does not see itself primarily as a museum of technical history, but rather as a modern museum of cultural history.The Museum in Dresden tells a general cultural history of violence, whereas the Berlin Museum focuses on aerial warfare as the most recent development in the military use of force.Visitors will learn how aerial warfare has altered our views on warfare. The following topics are at the center of our presentation:\u2022 Crossing Borders. Airplanes enable us to transport information, diplomats and casualties quickly and across borders. At the same time, the emergence of the aerial bombing warfare resulted in the abolition of the old dichotomy between front and hinterland.\u2022 Invisible Perpetrators, Invisible Victims. Among other things, aerial warfare is characterized by high speeds, tremendous ranges and increasingly huge kill capacities. These characteristics result in a depersonalization in the relationship between perpetrators and victims.\u2022 Cover instead of Flight. People on the ground are practically unable to escape the violence from the air. They are faced with sudden alarms and have to look for cover in cellars and holes in the ground.\u2022 Role Models. The role of a pilot has changed continuously over the years: In the eyes of his contemporaries, he was a daring technical pioneer and knight of the air, a daredevil, an engine operator and a flight engineer. Pilots were sacrificed and became killers. Not all pilots are men. What will be their role in an era of unmanned aviation?\u2022 Military and Society. The doctrines of employment and the manner of taking responsibility for the protection of lives reflect the political system and self-image of the various air forces. For that reason, military aviation cannot be examined separately but must be seen in the context of its social and political environment.The Museum of Military History on the Berlin-Gatow airfield sees itself a place of learning for military Bundeswehr personnel as well as interested visitors. As an interface between the military and society, it hopes to encourage discussions and to contribute towards the integration of the armed forces into public life in Germany.The museum collection contains more than 200 airplanes, numerous air defence systems and sensors, uniforms, equipment, art, documents and pictures (a total collection of 600,000 items).",

Immerse yourself in the monumental Panorama Installation from the vantage point of a 4-meter high visitors' platform - a perfect illusion of the history of this city. The Berlin artist Yadegar Asisi depicts life at and in the shadow of the Wall on a fictional autumn day in the 1980s on a 1:1 scale. He thus spectacularly brings the divided city to life for young and old alike. The Panorama experience is supplemented by a photo exhibition with over 100 photos of contemporary witnesses, which gives the visitor personal insights into the period of the Wall.",

    "content": "The Theater im Keller was founded on January 3rd, 1987, and offers its visitors more than 150 performances every year. Despite the German name (Theater im Keller translates into \"theater in the basement\"), the theater is on the ground floor rather than in a basement. The name originated in the early years, when the productions took place in a basement vault. As demand grew, Michael Brenncke, the theater's director since 1987, decided to move the production into the premises of a former storefront. Since then, the studio theater has established itself as a small playhouse in Berlin's \"Reuterkiez\" district, and its reputation has spread well beyond the city limits. Primarily, travesty shows are produced and performed here, because that is precisely what the Theater im Keller is renowned for. Since 2009, a contemporary, stylish bar and lounge can be found in the foyer.",

    "content": "Directly at Checkpoint Charlie is Berlin's Trabi Museum, dedicated to the history of the famous car with the two-stroke engine. Serial production of the Trabant started in Zwickau in 1958 and it is definitely the most famous car from East Germany. On display are the various stages of development of the East German people's car and its potential uses for camping or as a military vehicle. Also on display are rarities such as the Trabant P70 with its wooden chassis or the racing Trabi. And if you'd like your own chance to drive a Trabi, all you have to do is cross the street to Trabi World, where you can book various tours through East and West Berlin or along the former course of the Wall.",

The programme focusses on social and political issues, and one of the theatre's distinctive features is a wide range of directing styles, which also includes new forms of dance and musical theatre. Alongside directors from Berlin such as Thomas Ostermeier, Michael Thalheimer, Falk Richter and Marius von Mayenburg internationally renowned directors from abroad work here, for example Alvis Hermanis, Katie Mitchell and the choreographer Constanza Macras. The productions concentrate on telling stories - both classical and contemporary - and on the ensemble, which includes film stars like Nina Hoss and Lars Eidinger. The Schaubuhne is one of the best known German theatres in the world and plays over 100 performances across the globe every year. In Berlin, up to three shows from the large repertoire are shown every night, frequently with English and French surtitles.",
