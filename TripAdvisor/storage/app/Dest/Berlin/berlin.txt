Situated at the historic site on Bernauer Strasse, it extends along 1.4 kilometers of the former border strip. The memorial contains the last piece of Berlin Wall with the preserved grounds behind it and is thus able to convey an impression of how the border fortifications developed until the end of the 1980s. The events that took place here together with the preserved historical remnants and traces of border obstacles on display help to make the history of Germany's division comprehensible to visitors. The memorial is part of the Berlin Wall Foundation, which also includes the Marienfelde Refugee Center Museum, the central site dedicated to the history of flight and emigration in divided Germany. MOBILE TOURGUIDE Visitors to the Berlin Wall Memorial who have a smartphone or a tablet computer with internet access at their disposal have the opportunity to select an individual tour of the memorial grounds for themselves on the memorial's mobile website berliner-mauer.mobi.",

The 300-year old Zeughaus is one of the most important buildings of the Baroque period in Berlin and the oldest buildings at the boulevard Unter den Linden. In 2006 the Permanent Exhibition \u201cGerman History in Images and Artefacts\u201d was inaugurated here; it showcases 2000 years of eventful and enthralling German history as seen within its European context. 8000 selected objects from the extensive collections of the German Historical Museum furnish valuable evidence of history and reveal, on a surface area of 8000 square meters, a fascinating and vivid picture of the past. Supplementing the Permanent Exhibition are specialized temporary exhibitions displayed in the fascinating exhibition building designed by I.M. Pei. The spacious new structure with its glass and steel entrance lobby and distinctive winding staircase was opened in 2003. Definitive events and facets of German history are presented in a variety of special exhibitions on the four floors of the new building.",

Situated at the historic site on Bernauer Strasse, it extends along 1.4 kilometers of the former border strip. The memorial contains the last piece of Berlin Wall with the preserved grounds behind it and is thus able to convey an impression of how the border fortifications developed until the end of the 1980s. The events that took place here together with the preserved historical remnants and traces of border obstacles on display help to make the history of Germany's division comprehensible to visitors. The memorial is part of the Berlin Wall Foundation, which also includes the Marienfelde Refugee Center Museum, the central site dedicated to the history of flight and emigration in divided Germany. MOBILE TOURGUIDE Visitors to the Berlin Wall Memorial who have a smartphone or a tablet computer with internet access at their disposal have the opportunity to select an individual tour of the memorial grounds for themselves on the memorial's mobile website berliner-mauer.mobi.",

With its observation towers, attack dogs, trip wires and armed guards primed to shoot anyone trying to escape to the West, it was known as the \u201cdeath strip.\u201d\nThe park dates back to the early 1990s when local residents, noticing the rapid spread of self-seeded vegetation on the sandy strip of land, began planting trees and calling for the creation of a park. As a result, the city\u2019s politicians included Mauerpark in the city\u2019s bid to host the 2000 Olympics. Although Berlin\u2019s bid for the Olympics was not successful, the plea to build Mauerpark was.\nIn Mauerpark you can take a stroll, lie around, read, play on the swings, play boules and basketball, picnic in the birch grove, get involved in community gardening, go to the Rainbow Playground with the kids, watch musicians and performers in the amphitheatre, have a drink and a bite to eat in the outdoor cafes or hunt for bargains at the Sunday flea market.",

The 300-year old Zeughaus is one of the most important buildings of the Baroque period in Berlin and the oldest buildings at the boulevard Unter den Linden. In 2006 the Permanent Exhibition \u201cGerman History in Images and Artefacts\u201d was inaugurated here; it showcases 2000 years of eventful and enthralling German history as seen within its European context. 8000 selected objects from the extensive collections of the German Historical Museum furnish valuable evidence of history and reveal, on a surface area of 8000 square meters, a fascinating and vivid picture of the past. Supplementing the Permanent Exhibition are specialized temporary exhibitions displayed in the fascinating exhibition building designed by I.M. Pei. The spacious new structure with its glass and steel entrance lobby and distinctive winding staircase was opened in 2003. Definitive events and facets of German history are presented in a variety of special exhibitions on the four floors of the new building.",
