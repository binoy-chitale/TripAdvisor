    "content": "Visit the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne's most iconic landmark, where Victorians have been coming since 1934 to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women in war and peacekeeping. Enter the Shrine and experience the quiet solitude of the Sanctuary where hundreds of thousands pay their respects each year. All visitors are invited to participate in a Remembrance Ceremony featuring the Ray of Light re-enactment. Surrounded by the Shrine Reserve, the Shrine is elevated, overlooking the city of Melbourne within 13 hectares of beautiful parkland. Enjoy stunning views of the Reserve and many of Melbourne's landmarks from the balcony of the Shrine. Explore the monuments and memorials throughout the Reserve, including the Gallipoli Memorial, as well as the many remembrance trees dedicated to Victorian service units from the Boer War onwards. The Eternal Flame on the Second World War Forecourt symbolises eternal life for those who have served. The Ray of Light ceremony is central to the experience of the Shrine of Remembrance. A ray of natural sunlight passes through an aperture in the ceiling of the Sanctuary and falls onto the Stone of Remembrance over the word \"love\" at precisely 11.00 am on 11 November each year. This is the moment when the armistice was signed in 1918 marking the end of hostilities in the First World War. The ceremony is now reproduced every half hour using electric light to allow all visitors to the Shrine to experience it. The Shrine also has an extensive permanent and temporary exhibition space. The Galleries of Remembrance is a $45 million Victorian Government redevelopment that utilises 1,600 square metres of undercroft space beneath the Shrine. Over 850 objects illustrate the experiences of Australians at war and in peacekeeping operations, from Pre-Federation to the present day, with a particular focus on individual and unit stories of Victorian service and sacrifice. A highlight of the exhibition is the SS Devanha lifeboat, a Gallipoli landing boat on loan from the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The Devanha carried soldiers of the 12th Battalion and the 3rd Field Ambulance into Anzac Cove on the morning of 25 April 1915.",

St Paul's is built on the site where the first public Christian services in Melbourne were led by Dr Alexander Thomson in 1836. Soon afterwards a small wooden chapel was built elsewhere, and the area became a corn market until 1848, when it was made available for the building of the bluestone St Paul's Parish Church. Consecrated in 1852, this Church was used until 1885, when it was demolished to make way for the present Cathedral. The decision to build on the site of the existing church was made because of its proximity to the railway and soon to be completed cable tramway service.The Swanston Street and Flinders Street corner remains one of Melbourne's busiest intersections today, ensuring the Cathedral is a place at the heart of city life.",

    "content": "Melbourne Central is a diverse shopping and dining destination that invites you to keep exploring. Bringing together more than 300 retailers over five levels, Melbourne Central is home to an absorbing range of Australian and international fashion brands from Gorman, Alannah Hill, Crumpler to Vans and Nique. Take a sugar break at Cupcake Central, a beauty break at Mecca Maxima or an indulgent time-out at Self Centred Medi Spa. The buzz continues after dark, whether you are lurking in Knox Lane with its graffiti by Melbourne's infamous DABS and MYLA, or basking beneath a screen in the Hoyts Lux Cinema. Spanning two city blocks, the centre boasts several unique architectural features including the giant Marionette Watch hanging in Shot Tower Square, famous for its hourly rendition of the Australian anthem 'Waltzing Matilda'. The square is named after the historic Coops Shot Tower a bullet-making facility built in 1889. Today, the brick shot tower stands proudly in its original place, protected by a modern twist: the magnificent Glass Cone, designed in the '80s by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa. While it floods the centre with natural light, the Glass Cone's design also makes it one of Melbourne's most recognisable landmarks. Located atop the City Loop Melbourne Central train station and can be found on the iconic free city circle tram route. Melbourne Central boasts 822 car parks making it the perfect base for Melbourne city excursions. The five-star-rated parents' retreat offers a sanctuary for families, while The Little Library free book exchange provide spaces for pause and escape from the city's frenetic buzz. Whatever brings you to Melbourne, be it shopping, exploring, lunch, brunch or simply an unexpected adventure, it is all waiting between Lonsdale and La Trobe. Or to go behind the scenes book a place on Melbourne Central's Unlocked Tour which leads visitors around hidden nooks, rarely-seen vantage points and secret rooftops. Bernadette Alibrando can also tell you the tales of Melbourne Central's huge range of artworks in the Walk to Art Tours. For bookings please visit the Melbourne Central website.",

    "content": "A visit to the historic landmark Cooks' Cottage, situated in the beautiful heritage-listed Fitzroy Gardens, is a must when exploring Melbourne. Built in 1755, Cooks' Cottage is the oldest building in Australia and a popular Melbourne tourist attraction. Originally located in Yorkshire, England, and built by the parents of Captain James Cook, the cottage was brought to Melbourne by Sir Russell Grimwade in 1934. Astonishingly, each brick was individually numbered, packed into barrels and then shipped to Australia. Combining modern interpretations of Captain Cook's adventures, centuries-old antiques, a delightful English cottage garden and volunteers dressed in 18th century costumes, Cooks' Cottage is a fascinating step back in time. Entry to the cottage includes a comprehensive fact sheet for a self-guided tour. Available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Thai, Indonesian, Japanese, German, French and Korean. School tours and group visits/tours are available. Seasonal school holiday programs and special events are also held throughout the year. Tickets and souvenirs can be purchased from the Fitzroy Gardens Visitor Centre, just 100 metres away.",

So many of the decisions that have helped shape Melbourne were made within the heritage-listed Town Hall. A mix of bluestone and Tasmanian freestone, the classically designed building features a clock tower and fine masonry. To go behind the scenes and visit the grand Council Chambers and stand where the Beatles and Abba waved from the impressive portico, take a Town Hall tour. As well as the Council Chambers, the Town Hall features a large auditorium, which was remodelled following a fire in 1925 and includes panels decorated with sepia figures. The auditorium's Grand Organ has featured in cutting-edge performances by a range of artists including Philip Glass, Paul Grabowski and the Necks. A free lunchtime concert series has been running since 2003, and the Grand Organ Museum offers visitors the opportunity to learn more about the organ and breathe air into its venerable pipes. Join a free Melbourne Town Hall Tour from Monday to Friday with tours departing at 11am and 1pm. Bookings essential.",

Since then the venue has been divided into two separate venues. Downstairs, Forum I is famous for its unique architecture, large stage, mesmerising proscenium and signature cabaret style booths. Upstairs, Forum II is a smaller venue with tiered seating, small stage, surround sound and cinema size screen. Renowned as one of Melbourne\u2019s most unique and best live music venues, the Forum plays host to many bands, singers, comedians and popular festivals every year. When not being used for live music, the venue comes alive as an amazing function space for events such as cocktail parties, launches and fashion events.",

    "content": "Coop's Shot Tower and Flanking Building are of historical and architectural significance to the State of Victoria.Coop's Shot Tower and Flanking Building are of historical significance as evidence of an early industrial process, and for their association with the Coop family, who had extensive interests in shot manufacture and smelting \u2013 they owned both of the two remaining towers in Melbourne, the other being in Clifton Hill. The tower provides tangible evidence of the original process of lead shot production, a process now largely forgotten. Its form reflects the shot production process: the shot was produced by dropping molten lead through sieves at the top of the tower into water at the bottom. The height of the Tower was necessary to allow the shot to form into spheres before reaching the bottom. At the height of its productive life, the Tower was producing six tons of shot per week. Also manufactured in the associated buildings were a diverse range of lead products, including nails, washers, sheeting, tubes, pipes and solder for leadlighters and plumbers.Coop's Shot Tower and Flanking Building are of historical significance as a reminder of the character of the 19th century city, in which residential, commercial and industrial uses existed in close proximity. There are now few remaining traces of central Melbourne's industrial past, giving the shot tower added importance.Coop's Shot Tower and Flanking Building are of architectural significance as a fine example of a rare and distinctive building type and as a Melbourne landmark for more than a century. The Tower was one of the tallest buildings in Melbourne for many years, second only to the shot tower in Clifton Hill, and remained a significant Melbourne landmark long after its closure. The building is carefully massed with its campanile-style central tower above the two storey factory with fine arched openings.",

    "content": "A cultural hub supporting arts, film, and visual performance Australia wide, with a Hellenic flavour. Housed in the historic Former Royal Mint building, the Museum is home to the long-term collection Gods, Myths & Mortals: Greek Treasures Across the Millennia from the iconic Benaki Museum, Athens. The collection provides a snapshot of Greek history, from Classical, to Byzantine, Post-Byzantine, and Neo-Hellenic, winding through 8,000 years of Greek civilisation around the ground floor of the Mint, including the original gold vault. From October 2015 the Museum will be the new home to Sean Godsell's award-winning MPavilion. The Museum holds events throughout the year, from the popular Summer Cinema program, to theatre, live music, and lectures. The first floor is currently closed due to infrastructure works, set to reopen mid-2016.",

The landscape is dominated by the Yarra River as it winds through the Warrandyte Gorge. The hills around Warrandyte have a distinctive bluish-green hue, typical of the Red Box foliage common in the area. The park consists of a number of different sections, each with its own attractions. Jumping creek has a large recreational area with wood barbeques, picnic tables, toilets and information shelter. Some wood is provided but it is advisable to bring your own. There is also a canoe launch at this reserve. Pound Bend is another picnic area with tables, toilets, great views and a good chance of seeing Koalas in the trees. There are also a number of easy walks for visitors throughout the park. The park is 24km north-east of Melbourne. Access is mainly via sealed roads; Warrandyte Road, Research-Warrandyte Road and Ringwood-Warrandyte Road. Mountain bikes are permitted within the park but must remain on management vehicle only tracks.",

    "content": "Wattle Park is a popular metropolitan park that has a blend of historic buildings, picnic grounds, recreational facilities and natural bush spread over 55 hectares. Huge gum trees, wattles, seasonal wildflowers and ponds are all significant features. Wattle Park is an excellent location for a variety of activities from jogging to bird watching, golf to cricket. Meet for a picnic or barbecue and in the warmer months you may see the Melbourne Tramways Band playing on a Sunday afternoon. The beautiful historic Wattle Park Chalet, a quaint European-style establishment built in 1928. The Chalet, popular for functions, is set among exotic trees and sweeping lawns. For a great escape within the suburbs, this is the place to visit. Despite the urban surroundings of Wattle Park, there's also a surprising diversity of flora and fauna within its boundaries. Children can even enjoy being a tram conductor in one of the old trams. The nine hole public golf course is a lovely setting to practice your swing. There are also three tennis courts. Visit the filtration ponds alongside Damper Creek and see ducks and frogs amongst the native rushes. Immerse yourself in the history and nature of the park. Wattle Park is on Riversdale Rd Burwood. Vehicle access is from Riversdale Rd. Enter by foot from Riversdale Rd, Warrigal Rd, Patterson Ave or Elgar Rd. Tram 70 stops near the park entrance. The toilets and most paths in the park are accessible for visitors with limited mobility.",

    "content": "Westgate Park is a nature sanctuary located in the heart of industrial Melbourne. Having undergone many transformations before emerging as one of Melbourne\u2019s most visible parks, Westgate Park is a vibrant example of how a wasteland can become a flourishing ecological and recreational wetland environment. Westgate Park offers a range of attractions and activities, located along the eastern banks of the Yarra River under the Westgate Bridge; the park offers spectacular views to the mouth of the Yarra and the city skyline. Enjoy a picnic lunch with friends or family or cycle along the Yarra River or the Port Melbourne foreshore. The healthy bird population also attracts bird watching enthusiasts. Barbecues and picnic areas are free and available for shared use. Westgate Park is located along the eastern banks of the Yarra River, under the Westgate Bridge. Access is via Todd Rd or near the end of Lorimer Street, Port Melbourne.",
