         "content":"Visit the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne's most iconic landmark, where Victorians have been coming since 1934 to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women in war and peacekeeping. Enter the Shrine and experience the quiet solitude of the Sanctuary where hundreds of thousands pay their respects each year. All visitors are invited to participate in a Remembrance Ceremony featuring the Ray of Light re-enactment. Surrounded by the Shrine Reserve, the Shrine is elevated, overlooking the city of Melbourne within 13 hectares of beautiful parkland. Enjoy stunning views of the Reserve and many of Melbourne's landmarks from the balcony of the Shrine. Explore the monuments and memorials throughout the Reserve, including the Gallipoli Memorial, as well as the many remembrance trees dedicated to Victorian service units from the Boer War onwards. The Eternal Flame on the Second World War Forecourt symbolises eternal life for those who have served. The Ray of Light ceremony is central to the experience of the Shrine of Remembrance. A ray of natural sunlight passes through an aperture in the ceiling of the Sanctuary and falls onto the Stone of Remembrance over the word \"love\" at precisely 11.00 am on 11 November each year. This is the moment when the armistice was signed in 1918 marking the end of hostilities in the First World War. The ceremony is now reproduced every half hour using electric light to allow all visitors to the Shrine to experience it. The Shrine also has an extensive permanent and temporary exhibition space. The Galleries of Remembrance is a $45 million Victorian Government redevelopment that utilises 1,600 square metres of undercroft space beneath the Shrine. Over 850 objects illustrate the experiences of Australians at war and in peacekeeping operations, from Pre-Federation to the present day, with a particular focus on individual and unit stories of Victorian service and sacrifice. A highlight of the exhibition is the SS Devanha lifeboat, a Gallipoli landing boat on loan from the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The Devanha carried soldiers of the 12th Battalion and the 3rd Field Ambulance into Anzac Cove on the morning of 25 April 1915.",

St Paul's is built on the site where the first public Christian services in Melbourne were led by Dr Alexander Thomson in 1836. Soon afterwards a small wooden chapel was built elsewhere, and the area became a corn market until 1848, when it was made available for the building of the bluestone St Paul's Parish Church. Consecrated in 1852, this Church was used until 1885, when it was demolished to make way for the present Cathedral. The decision to build on the site of the existing church was made because of its proximity to the railway and soon to be completed cable tramway service.The Swanston Street and Flinders Street corner remains one of Melbourne's busiest intersections today, ensuring the Cathedral is a place at the heart of city life.",

         "content":"Visit the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne's most iconic landmark, where Victorians have been coming since 1934 to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women in war and peacekeeping. Enter the Shrine and experience the quiet solitude of the Sanctuary where hundreds of thousands pay their respects each year. All visitors are invited to participate in a Remembrance Ceremony featuring the Ray of Light re-enactment. Surrounded by the Shrine Reserve, the Shrine is elevated, overlooking the city of Melbourne within 13 hectares of beautiful parkland. Enjoy stunning views of the Reserve and many of Melbourne's landmarks from the balcony of the Shrine. Explore the monuments and memorials throughout the Reserve, including the Gallipoli Memorial, as well as the many remembrance trees dedicated to Victorian service units from the Boer War onwards. The Eternal Flame on the Second World War Forecourt symbolises eternal life for those who have served. The Ray of Light ceremony is central to the experience of the Shrine of Remembrance. A ray of natural sunlight passes through an aperture in the ceiling of the Sanctuary and falls onto the Stone of Remembrance over the word \"love\" at precisely 11.00 am on 11 November each year. This is the moment when the armistice was signed in 1918 marking the end of hostilities in the First World War. The ceremony is now reproduced every half hour using electric light to allow all visitors to the Shrine to experience it. The Shrine also has an extensive permanent and temporary exhibition space. The Galleries of Remembrance is a $45 million Victorian Government redevelopment that utilises 1,600 square metres of undercroft space beneath the Shrine. Over 850 objects illustrate the experiences of Australians at war and in peacekeeping operations, from Pre-Federation to the present day, with a particular focus on individual and unit stories of Victorian service and sacrifice. A highlight of the exhibition is the SS Devanha lifeboat, a Gallipoli landing boat on loan from the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The Devanha carried soldiers of the 12th Battalion and the 3rd Field Ambulance into Anzac Cove on the morning of 25 April 1915.",

St Paul's is built on the site where the first public Christian services in Melbourne were led by Dr Alexander Thomson in 1836. Soon afterwards a small wooden chapel was built elsewhere, and the area became a corn market until 1848, when it was made available for the building of the bluestone St Paul's Parish Church. Consecrated in 1852, this Church was used until 1885, when it was demolished to make way for the present Cathedral. The decision to build on the site of the existing church was made because of its proximity to the railway and soon to be completed cable tramway service.The Swanston Street and Flinders Street corner remains one of Melbourne's busiest intersections today, ensuring the Cathedral is a place at the heart of city life.",

         "content":"Visit the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne's most iconic landmark, where Victorians have been coming since 1934 to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women in war and peacekeeping. Enter the Shrine and experience the quiet solitude of the Sanctuary where hundreds of thousands pay their respects each year. All visitors are invited to participate in a Remembrance Ceremony featuring the Ray of Light re-enactment. Surrounded by the Shrine Reserve, the Shrine is elevated, overlooking the city of Melbourne within 13 hectares of beautiful parkland. Enjoy stunning views of the Reserve and many of Melbourne's landmarks from the balcony of the Shrine. Explore the monuments and memorials throughout the Reserve, including the Gallipoli Memorial, as well as the many remembrance trees dedicated to Victorian service units from the Boer War onwards. The Eternal Flame on the Second World War Forecourt symbolises eternal life for those who have served. The Ray of Light ceremony is central to the experience of the Shrine of Remembrance. A ray of natural sunlight passes through an aperture in the ceiling of the Sanctuary and falls onto the Stone of Remembrance over the word \"love\" at precisely 11.00 am on 11 November each year. This is the moment when the armistice was signed in 1918 marking the end of hostilities in the First World War. The ceremony is now reproduced every half hour using electric light to allow all visitors to the Shrine to experience it. The Shrine also has an extensive permanent and temporary exhibition space. The Galleries of Remembrance is a $45 million Victorian Government redevelopment that utilises 1,600 square metres of undercroft space beneath the Shrine. Over 850 objects illustrate the experiences of Australians at war and in peacekeeping operations, from Pre-Federation to the present day, with a particular focus on individual and unit stories of Victorian service and sacrifice. A highlight of the exhibition is the SS Devanha lifeboat, a Gallipoli landing boat on loan from the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The Devanha carried soldiers of the 12th Battalion and the 3rd Field Ambulance into Anzac Cove on the morning of 25 April 1915.",

         "content":"Visit the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne's most iconic landmark, where Victorians have been coming since 1934 to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women in war and peacekeeping. Enter the Shrine and experience the quiet solitude of the Sanctuary where hundreds of thousands pay their respects each year. All visitors are invited to participate in a Remembrance Ceremony featuring the Ray of Light re-enactment. Surrounded by the Shrine Reserve, the Shrine is elevated, overlooking the city of Melbourne within 13 hectares of beautiful parkland. Enjoy stunning views of the Reserve and many of Melbourne's landmarks from the balcony of the Shrine. Explore the monuments and memorials throughout the Reserve, including the Gallipoli Memorial, as well as the many remembrance trees dedicated to Victorian service units from the Boer War onwards. The Eternal Flame on the Second World War Forecourt symbolises eternal life for those who have served. The Ray of Light ceremony is central to the experience of the Shrine of Remembrance. A ray of natural sunlight passes through an aperture in the ceiling of the Sanctuary and falls onto the Stone of Remembrance over the word \"love\" at precisely 11.00 am on 11 November each year. This is the moment when the armistice was signed in 1918 marking the end of hostilities in the First World War. The ceremony is now reproduced every half hour using electric light to allow all visitors to the Shrine to experience it. The Shrine also has an extensive permanent and temporary exhibition space. The Galleries of Remembrance is a $45 million Victorian Government redevelopment that utilises 1,600 square metres of undercroft space beneath the Shrine. Over 850 objects illustrate the experiences of Australians at war and in peacekeeping operations, from Pre-Federation to the present day, with a particular focus on individual and unit stories of Victorian service and sacrifice. A highlight of the exhibition is the SS Devanha lifeboat, a Gallipoli landing boat on loan from the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The Devanha carried soldiers of the 12th Battalion and the 3rd Field Ambulance into Anzac Cove on the morning of 25 April 1915.",
