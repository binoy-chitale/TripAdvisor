Twenty metres underground, the ossuary houses the remains of approximately six million Parisians, gradually transferred between the end of the 18th century and the mid 19th century, as the capital's cemeteries were closed for health reasons. Along a tangle of dark galleries, visitors discover a presentation of death with bones arranged in a romantic macabre decor. This unique site is a moving testimony to the history of Parisians and invites visitors on a timeless journey.",

Espace Dali, located in the heart of the famous artists' village, Montmartre, exhibits the largest collection of artworks by Salvador Dali in France. Dali as you have never seen before! The collection is the fruit of the emblematic surrealist artist's extravagant inspiration: theatrical sculptures, erotic, dreamlike or irresistibly humorous engravings, poetic objects and furniture, are all part of the phantasmagorical universe of the inventor of soft watches. The multiple facets of the Catalan Master 3D Surrealism Thanks to Dali, everything can be transformed by the magic of dreams: the Space Elephant with spindly legs seems to defy gravity, a watch melts from a branch, a snail spreads its wings and Venus has drawers. Stories and wonders Dali had an encyclopedic culture and was fascinated by major themes from literature, mythology and religion. He used many different techniques to illustrate universal texts: Alice in Wonderland, Romeo and Juliet, Don Quixote, The Bible... As well as more personal works, such as Moses and Monotheism or The Alchemy of the Philosophers. Each book is an art object. Sculptures, drawings, water colors, engravings, lithographs, Espace Dali invites us to explore the main themes of his work: dreams, mythology, sensuality...",

The museum traces the evolution of the Jewish world via its artistic and cultural heritage, focussing on the history of the Jews in France since the Middle Ages and evoking the communities of Europe and North Africa. Its collection, one of the finest in the world, comprises religious objects, manuscripts, textiles and unique archive documents concerning the Dreyfus Affair. Special importance is given to the Jewish presence in the arts, featuring the painters of the School of Paris (Chagall, Kiko\u00efne, Soutine...) and contemporary artists such Christian Boltanski and Sophie Calle. The museum runs programmes of workshops for children, families and adults, guided tours, lectures, live performances and films throughout the year.",

They even look good when they are in the gym. So what's the secret? The whole shopping experience for Parisians involves more than just popping in and out of stylish boutiques offering high-quality fashion. The Parisians also love lingering over lunch in a chic restaurant overlooking the river Seine or the French Statue of Liberty. Some of them, especially high-flying Parisians also opt for a personal shopper when they have a free hour or two between meetings. So how can you shop like a real Parisian? It's easy. All you have to do is plan a trip to the Beaugrenelle shopping mall, just a short walk from the Eiffel Tower. If you are looking for perfect Parisian fashion basics, chic shoes, a fun accessory to brighten up your look or that timeless evening outfit that you just can't find at home, check out Beaugrenelle and you'll find what you've been looking for, and much more. Happy shopping!",
