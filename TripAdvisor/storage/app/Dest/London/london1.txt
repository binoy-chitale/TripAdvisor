The Elizabeth Tower was completed in 1859 and the Great Clock started on 31 May. The Great Bell's strikes were heard for the first time on 11 July and the quarter bells first chimed on 7 September. All visits to Big Ben and the Elizabeth Tower tours are now suspended due to refurbishment with the last tour having taken place on 16 December 2016. Tours are scheduled to resume in early 2020 once the work is complete. Visitors can still book tickets for a number of other tours at the Houses of Parliament which take place on Saturdays throughout the year and on weekdays during Parliamentary recesses.",

Don't miss Gypsy, one of the greatest ever Broadway musicals, as it transfers to the West End following its sell-out, rapturously acclaimed five-star run at Chichester Festival Theatre. Imelda Staunton delivers a 'knock-out performance' (The Independent) as Momma Rose in Jonathan Kent's 'dazzling revival' (Mail on Sunday), alongside Lara Pulver, who reprises her 'stunning' (The Independent) role as Louise. They'll be joined by Peter Davison as Herb, in this gloriously entertaining musical fable that features 'showstopping' (Mail on Sunday) choreography from Stephen Mear. Based on the true life memoirs of legendary burlesque entertainer, Gypsy Rose Lee, it tells the tale of Momma Rose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise, trekking across America in their family vaudeville act. But times are changing, audiences are expecting more, and the two girls have their own ambitions in mind. The rise of burlesque is upon them, and nothing will ever be the same again for Momma Rose. With lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book by Arthur Laurents and music by Jule Styne, this moving and 'scintillating' (The Times) production of Gypsy is the first to be seen in London for 40 years.",

Westminster Cathedral must be one of the busiest churches in the United Kingdom. Located in the heart of London, it is the mother-church of England & Wales. People are drawn to this great edifice from all over London, all over the country and the world. If you are trying to imagine \u2018what goes on\u2019 here, consider that there are seven masses each day, many great services of worship on special occasions and unique gatherings of every description which fill the Cathedral to the doors. Westminster Cathedral Choir, justly renowned for consistent excellence, sings at the Solemn Mass each evening - with few exceptions. Even when no public ceremony is taking place, the private prayer of individual believers is a work of faith, continuously in progress. The Cathedral is a sacred space at the heart of a great city, dedicated to the worship of God.",

Other departments include the Urban Retreat at Harrods spa, a theatre ticket bureau, and The Studio, the store's interior-design service. Qatar Holding acquired the business in 2010, and it continues to guide - and invest strongly in - the store according to its philosophy: Anything is possible.

Previous buildings were managed by the great actor David Garrick and the famous playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and he current, fourth, building was opened in 1812.The theatre was renowned for its spectacular Victorian melodramas and pantomimes but since the 1920s its history has mirrored the development of the modern musical. From the original London productions of American musicals Rose Marie, The Desert Song and Show Boat, through Ivor Novello\u2019s romantic operettas and Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s groundbreaking post-war shows to The Producers and The Lord of the Rings. My Fair Lady held the record as the theatres longest run for many years but Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s record breaking production of Miss Saigon, at ten years, is the current record holder.",

They included such familiar titles as A Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook, Thark, Plunder and A Cup of Kindness. Nearly 30 years later, on 15 December 1960, the Royal Shakespeare Company took over the Aldwych as its London base.During the next 21 years, prior to the company moving to its theatre in the Barbican, history was frequently made.The Aldwych is currently the residence for the Olivier & Tony award winning Beautiful - The Carole King Musical",

As Samuel Johnson so eloquently said of London: 'When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.\" The same is very much true of Old Spitalfields Market.\n",

No membership, walk in freely, open 24/7, 6 bars, Pokerstars cash poker deck, award-winning Heliot Steak House, cabaret theatre, 2 smoking terraces & 3 floors of gambling. Great fun for gamblers and people just out for a good time. Shows all the best American sports, including all NFL games. International Vegas style regulations. The Hippodrome is one of the most widely recognised entertainment landmarks in the capital. Originally a variety theatre and home to the world-renowned Talk Of The Town, it is now the most famous casino and entertainment venue in the country and recently won Best Casino Operator in Europe 2015. A \u00a350m renovation reinstated many of the theatre's original Edwardian architectural features, creating a unique venue that combines four floors of world class casino gaming with live theatre, an award winning steak house, six bars and a two tier smoking terrace. Since its opening in July 2012 the Hippodrome has attracted 5 million visitors, a combination of dedicated and casual gamers, theatregoers, business and tourist audiences and those keen to view one of the most spectacular venues in London. It is testament to the success of the Hippodrome that it was the venue pop superstar Prince chose to play his final UK gig in his 2014 tour.",

One of Charles\u2019 last sights, as he walked through the Banqueting House to his death, was the magnificent ceiling, painted by Peter Paul Rubens in 1630-4. Banqueting House is the last and only surviving part of Whitehall Palace, once the largest palace in Europe, destroyed by fire in 1698.",

The Foundling Hospital, which continues today as the children\u2019s charity Coram, was established in 1739 by the philanthropist Captain Thomas Coram, as \u2018a hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children\u2019. Instrumental in helping Coram realise his vision were the artist William Hogarth, who encouraged leading artists of the day to donate work, and the composer George Frideric Handel, who gave annual benefit concerts of his Messiah. In doing so, they created London\u2019s first public art gallery and their creative generosity set the template for the ways in which the arts can support philanthropy. The Foundling Museum celebrates their vision and continues their work by enabling artists, musicians and writers to work alongside vulnerable young people and cast new light on the histories we tell.",

It remained the family home until Freud's daughter Anna, a pioneer of child psychoanalysis, died in 1982. Then at her wish it became a Museum. The centrepiece is Freud\u2019s study, with his now iconic psychoanalytic couch and collection of antiquities, preserved as they were in his lifetime. The Museum offers a lively programme of events, courses and conferences, as well as a research resource, education service and venue hire for private functions.",

A Roman pavement, Saxon stonework, Mediaeval paintings and statues, and the glorious Grinling Gibbons font cover are all on show. This is the church where the Knights Templar had their London trials, Samuel Pepys watched the Great Fire of London from the tower, where William Penn (founder of Pennsylvania) was baptised and where President John Quincy Adams married a local girl. It is the founding place of Toc H and 'Tubby' Clayton was Vicar here for 40 years. The church has a characterful Crypt Museum and an excellent cafe - The Kitchen.",
